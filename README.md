Greetings gentlmen! Nothing has happened recently... I just want to write up some encourage words and imagine what this work will be look like.
Not a programmer myself but several layers and I had a little conversation in tranqulity some time (3 days ago?) and figured we want to play with the 15 years of eve trading data just released by CCP. 

The main thouhgts are that we might use some machine learning and statistics tool to dig something out from this database and obtain (strong/weak) relations or indicators that might be helpful to (some) players.
Based on my limited economic knowedge, one of the possible applications is that maybe we could found some negative correlations between goods (thousand of them). Then, as an investor, you know how to hedge the risk (just googled this word) and increase your expected payoff.

Also, we might found some connections between trades, mining and industry process and how are they affecting the eve world (daydreaming). Who knows? Maybe we could find the most profitbale job in the game!

Hope this works out fine! Let's go!
