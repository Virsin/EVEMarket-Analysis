There are lots of threads for [multiple clients](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/technology-research/eve-launcher)



## Where I am looking

###Official forums

 [third-party-developers](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/technology-research/third-party-developers), CPP proved apps, ready to use ones, and perhaps, best ones.

### Google search

it's a wide wide search,,, return lots of news, applications,,,, but somehow I am not sure whether it would work for current version, and I may can not access the code.

For the 15+ years history, there are tons of `app` for eve online, for excel based to platform development (e.g. python).

### Github

Yeah, where we are now. Tons of project like this, and most of them are small trail, not really reach something functional and robust. 

But it's very useful to look at the path of how them develop the program,,,,,e.g. how do them package the API

###Google Scholar

I have to say, the results are so `AMAZING` !!!

I have not expected that [About 482,000 results (**0.09** sec)](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=eve+online&btnG=)

Please help yourself!!! crazy crazy

Should we write a journal paper together???

###Brief feedback 

I have to say, the most applicable development platform is not `python`, it is the platform for web application development, such as `Java`

The most important part is  `data acquisition`, even real time data communication via the API 

The most common data format is `XML` (for the data flying between app and API)

 ..... I am not good at web application development, so I should shut up now.

What I found it's litter different than our original propose-- use the history data.
